The National Emergency Medicine Programme presents the Irish Children’s Triage System (ICTS) for the prioritisation and
assessment of paediatric patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) in Ireland. The system supports safer, more
effective, timely ED care and reflects the importance of child and family experiences of emergency care. The ICTS makes a very
significant contribution to the suite of clinical tools developed by the National Emergency Medicine Programme to drive
improvement in the safety, quality and value of emergency care in Ireland.  
The triage of children in EDs is an established standard of care in international and national practice. However the triage of
children can be difficult compared to adults and additional triage parameters are recommended to reflect age-related physiological
differences, children’s presenting signs and symptoms, significant paediatric co-morbidities and common Paediatric Emergency
Medicine diagnoses. 
The development of the ICTS was prompted by the triage experiences of front-line ED nurses and doctors caring for children and
advanced by the Emergency Nursing Interest Group (ENIG) of the National Emergency Medicine Programme as a safety and
quality improvement initiative.  The development and testing of the ICTS has been conducted under the guidance of a Steering
Group composed of stakeholders from within Emergency Medicine and senior clinicians across a number of hospitals. The ICTS
has undergone extensive stakeholder consultation and the National Emergency Medicine Programme and Office for Nursing and
Midwifery Services Director are therefore pleased to endorse the recommendations outlined in this document and recommend
that ICTS be adopted as the national standard of triage for children and should be adopted in all EDs in Ireland that see paediatric
patients. Implementation of the ICTS will contribute significantly to paediatric patient care in our EDs and will promote safety,
quality of care, improved access and patient experience in emergency care in Ireland.

This document describes the Irish Children’s Triage System (ICTS), a child-specific triage tool that should be followed for the
prioritisation and assessment of paediatric patients presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in Ireland. 
Locally developed paediatric triage systems had been in place in two Paediatric EDs in Dublin, Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital,
Crumlin (OLCHC) and Temple Street Children’s University Hospital, (TSCUH). Formal evaluations of these systems indicated that
they were safe and effective tools. As a quality improvement initiative, the National Emergency Medicine Programme (EMP)
through its Emergency Nursing Interest Group (ENIG) convened an ICTS project subgroup comprising senior nurses from seven
EDs (children’s only and mixed) and specialists in Paediatric Emergency Medicine. This group collaboratively produced the
national ICTS, based largely on the pre-existing tool in use in OLCHC with input from TSCUH.
The work of the project subgroup was overseen by a National Steering Group of key stakeholders and experts in the area of
paediatric emergency care. The ICTS was successfully piloted and evaluated in six EDs across the country in 2013, namely: 
 Cork University Hospital
 Galway University Hospital
 National Children’s Hospital, Tallaght
 Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda
 Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin
 Temple Street Children’s University Hospital
1.1 objectives of the icts
 To develop a specific triage tool to clinically assess children attending EDs that facilitates the prompt recognition of acuity
for ill or injured children.
 To develop a tool tailored to include clinical elements such as physiological vital signs, pain assessment, temperature and
other special guidelines specific to the needs of children. 
 To provide an evidence-based approach to the triage of children that supports clinical decision making with regard to the
symptoms and clinical management of the patient.
 To provide a National Standard for Children’s Triage which ensures that children receive the same standard and quality of
care regardless of where in the country they present for treatment. 
1.2 approach 
When developing the ICTS tool, the sub-group agreed to use a similar format to that of the Manchester Triage System (Mackway-
Jones et al 1997, 2006 & 2014) as it was considered appropriate to build on a system that was already familiar to staff rather
than introduce a completely new system that would require substantial re-education and training.
1. Purpose 
V1  |  Irish Children’s Triage System  |  National Emergency Medicine Programme  |  2016©

The term triage comes from the French verb ‘trier’ meaning to separate, sort, sift or select. It was a concept originally developed
by Dr Dominique Jean Larrey, a military surgeon during the Napoleonic Wars, and was used to sort soldiers wounded in battle
for the purpose of establishing treatment priorities. 
Changes in the health care delivery system in the United States forced EDs to consider alternative ways of handling an increase
in the number of patient attendances during the 1950s and early 1960s (Gilboy et al 2005). EDs recognised that a method to sort
patients and identify those needing immediate care was required. This provided the impetus to have ED triage systems in place.
Doctors and nurses who had used the triage process effectively in the military environment introduced triage into civilian EDs.
The transition of the triage process from the military environment to US EDs was considered very successful (Gilboy et al 2005).
Across the world EDs are faced with increasing numbers of patients presenting faster than they can be seen. Longer waits for
care make the use of reliable, valid triage systems essential to patient safety (Storm-Versloot et al 2011). Triage is the rapid and
preliminary assessment which identifies and sorts patients based on their need for or likely benefit from immediate medical
treatment (Fitzgerald et al 2009). Additionally, there are patients who will not require major resources for assessment and treatment
and could be seen in a low-intensity (fast-track/ambulatory unit) area by a doctor or an Advanced Nurse Practitioner. Identifying
these patients as they present permits the ED to maximise resources and clinical space and allow appropriate resources to be
invested in sicker patients at the same time as the less acute and less resource-dependent patients have their needs met.
International healthcare systems in the United Kingdom (Manchester Triage System 1997, 2006 & 2014), Canada (Canadian
Paediatric Triage and Acuity Scale 2001 & 2008), and Australia and New Zealand (Australasian Triage Scale, ACEM 2013) have
designed national triage systems to attend to patient needs based on acuity of presentation, improve patient safety and enhance
satisfaction. Although the United States has a variety of triage tools (3-tier to 5-tier systems), the most commonly used triage
system in the US is the 5-tier Emergency Severity Index (1998, 2012). Five-level triage systems have been shown to be more
reliable and valid than three-level systems (Travers et al 2002, College of Emergency Nursing, Australia 2012).
2. introduction
V1  |  Irish Children’s Triage System  |  National Emergency Medicine Programme  |  2016©

To ensure transparency and uniformity, a formally structured triage system for ED patients is advocated. Internationally, the most
commonly used triage processes are 5-tiered in nature and classify the acuity of a patient’s condition based chiefly on the patient’s
presenting complaint and findings on assessment (Murray et al 2004, ACEM 2013). Acuity rating levels are used to prioritise
patients for care and characteristically involve assigning a numeric score to patients, such as triage category 1 (most acute) to
triage category 5 (least acute). The presenting complaint determines which flowchart is followed. Each flowchart is based on a
five-step decision process that uses general and condition-specific discriminators at each step to assign patients to one of the
five triage categories (Storm-Versloot et al 2009). The triage decision and acuity rating allocated to the patient determines the
ideal maximum time to first contact with the treating clinician (Mackway Jones et al 2006) and this prioritisation influences and
ultimately affects patient safety. It is imperative therefore, that patients in need of urgent care are identified immediately, as
adverse outcomes may otherwise occur while the patient is waiting. Mackway-Jones et al (2006, 2014) maintain that triage is a
fundamental element of ED clinical risk management. Inherent in the belief that triage is of value is the assumption that the
outcome of some patients will be improved if they are seen sooner whilst other patients will not be adversely affected by delays
in their care. 
Triage is frequently the first instance of clinical contact for patients and their carers presenting to the ED. It is consistently the
point at which emergency care begins in the acute hospital setting. Clinical decisions made by triage nurses require complex
cognitive processes. The ability to make efficient clinical judgments and decisions is critical, and the quality and accuracy of
triage decisions are central to appropriate and timely clinical care. Some authors suggest that response times (interval from time
of triage categorisation to treating clinician review) are ideals and not standards, based on the need for timely interventions that
improve outcomes (Warren et al 2001, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Health Administration Corporation 2011). However
ACEM (2013) suggests that the triage category outlines the maximum time that a patient should wait for a treating clinician
assessment. 
Triage also allows for the allocation of a patient to the most appropriate assessment and treatment area and contributes information
that helps to describe case-mix in the ED (ACEM 2013). Patients who are identified as safe to wait longer may be seen by another
caregiver such as an Advanced Nurse Practitioner (Veen & Moll 2009). The triage process should form the start of a documented
care pathway for each individual patient (Comhairle na nOspideal 2002).
The aims of triage are:
 To rapidly identify patients with urgent, life threatening conditions;
 To ensure that patients are treated in the order of their clinical urgency;  
 To initiate appropriate nursing interventions e.g. first aid, administer prescribed medication/analgesia and emergency
interventions; 
 To improve patient outcomes and safety within the department;
 To plan appropriate reassessment and management of patients who remain in a waiting area, dependent on their condition
and time frames; 
 To allocate patients to the most appropriate assessment and treatment area;
 To decrease congestion in emergency treatment areas;
 To assist in the identification of patients who could be seen by another health professional (e.g. Advanced Nurse
Practitioner);
 To contribute information that helps to define departmental acuity and describe departmental case-mix; 
 To facilitate patient and public education in relation to health promotion and injury prevention, when appropriate;
 To provide information to patients and families regarding services expected, care and waiting times; 
 To act as the liaison for members of the public and other health care professionals.
(Beveridge et al 1999, Murray et al 2004, Mackway-Jones et al 2006, ACEM 2013)
The initial features used to assess urgency in the Irish Children’s Triage System (ICTS) are a combination of:
 Presenting problem; 
 General appearance; 
 Physiological findings; 
 Age of the child; 
 Significant past medical history that may impact on the current attendance
3. the generic triage Process
V1  |  Irish Children’s Triage System  |  National Emergency Medicine Programme  |  2016©
7
Internationally, it is recommended that the triage assessment should take no longer than two to five minutes to obtain sufficient
information to determine urgency and identify any immediate care needs (Warren et al 2001, Gilboy et al 2005, Gerdtz et al 2007,
ACEM 2013). However Travers (1999) demonstrated that this target was only achieved 22% of the time. The triage process tends
to incur delays especially in the younger age group of attendees. 
Recording of vital signs in children, for example, is time consuming due to difficulty with cooperation (age-related), cognitive
ability and comprehension. Privacy also needs consideration as exposing children for assessment and examination is mandatory
in a number of circumstances, particularly where rashes need to be assessed or small infants need to be weighed and this can
only be performed in a private cubicle. Parental anxiety is another factor that cannot be overlooked and is often reduced by the
triage nurse. The commonly internationally accepted times associated with triage are based on adult triage.
The assessment of initial features, presenting problem, general appearance, physiological findings, age of the child and significant
past medical history should determine whether a patient is a category 1 (immediate) or 2 (very urgent) and accordingly should
be seen within the appropriate timeframe. A more thorough assessment may be required to determine lower triage categories.
The National Emergency Medicine Programme Report (2012) recommends that 95% of patients are triaged within 15 minutes
of presentation to an ED.
The documentation of the triage assessment in ICTS should include as a minimum the following essential details (In category 1
and 2 patients, some or all of these details and assessments will be carried out in parallel with medical assessment): 
 Date and time of assessment;
 Name of triage nurse;
 Chief presenting problem(s);
 Significant past history that may have an impact on current attendance;
 Relevant assessment findings;
 Appropriate vital signs, neurological observations, respiratory assessment, pain score, blood sugar depending on
presentation and findings;
 Diagnostic, first aid or treatment measures initiated; 
 Weight of the child as this is an essential component of paediatric medication calculations (critically ill patients will  have
their weight calculated using recognised locally agreed formula);
 Infectious contacts/immunocompromised patients identified to determine if the patient requires isolation;
 Vaccination status, medications and allergies;
 Initial triage category allocated;
 Ongoing patient assessments required;
 Waiting area/treatment area allocated.
(Beveridge et al 1999, ACEM 2013)
The role of the triage nurse also includes:
 Greeting the child and carer(s) in a warm, empathetic manner;
 Advising the child/carer to notify staff of any change in condition;
 Commencing the child on an appropriate observation regime dependent on their presenting complaint and triage category;
 Administering prescribed medication e.g. analgesia, following discussion with the treating clinician regarding presenting
complaint, assessment findings, past medical history (including allergies);
 Administering first aid treatment to the child (e.g. application of sling, temporary dressing, other appropriate interventions);
 Advising the child’s carer/family regarding waiting times and possible delays.
Triage nurses are always encouraged to use their experience and intuition to “up triage” the category (increase the acuity level),
even if the patient does not seem to fit exactly with the parameter or definitions on the triage flowchart because: 'if they look sick
then they probably are'. Likewise a nurse should be encouraged to use his / her intuition and not 'down triage' if he/she has
concerns (Berveridge et 1999).

4.1 Nursing assessment 
Prior to 2011, there were three triage systems in use for triaging children in Ireland: Manchester Triage System (MTS) in the
majority of EDs and two modified triage systems designed, tested and audited locally in OLCHC and TSCUH by local Triage
Committees consisting of Consultants in Emergency Medicine and senior ED nurses. 
In June 2011, the Clinical Nurse Managers 3 (CNM3) from OLCHC and TSCUH were invited to present their triage tools to the
Emergency Nursing Interest Group (ENIG). At ENIG meetings senior emergency nurses had expressed the view that MTS had
limitations as a tool when triaging children in their departments as many of the decisions made regarding the allocation of triage
categories were dependent on nurses’ experience with no consideration given, in particular, to the importance of abnormal pulse
and respirations in children. As a quality improvement initiative, a proposal was made by ENIG to the Emergency Medicine
Programme Working Group that a subgroup should be set up to design an Irish Children’s Triage System (ICTS). The objective
was to standardise a formal, comprehensive triage tool that would improve consistency between users and be suitable for triaging
children in all EDs with paediatric attendances in Ireland. The ICTS subgroup comprised of senior nurses from the three paediatric
hospitals and four hospitals with both adult and paediatric attendances. Professor Ronan O’Sullivan and Dr Carol Blackburn (both
OLCHC) were the medical leads and all Consultants in Emergency Medicine across the three paediatric EDs in Dublin supported
the project. 
A comprehensive analysis of the international contemporary triage systems (MTS, Canadian Paediatric Triage and Acuity Scale)
had been previously undertaken by the two hospitals who had designed local triage tools. A review of the literature identified
three options available when systems of triage are introduced into EDs (Fortes Lahdet 2009): 
 Adopt an existing, well-recognised and validated method; 
 Develop a national triage model that is suited to national needs; 
 Design a local model that reflects specific needs and interests. 
4.2 manchester triage system – Emergency triage (mts)
The MTS tool (1997, 2006 and 2014) is an example of a 5-tiered triage system which was referenced considerably whilst
developing the two local child-specific triage tools. It uses a series of flow charts for various "presentations" with key
"discriminators" to determine the triage category. MTS however, is primarily an adult triage tool (Beveridge et al in 1999,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Health Administration Corporation 2011) and authors suggest that general scales are less helpful (or
reliable) at the extremes of age. In 2011, MTS (2006) had 50 flowcharts on the most common presenting complaints to ED;
however only 7 of these were specific flow charts for triaging children (abdominal pain in children; crying baby; limping child;
irritable child; shortness of breath in children; unwell child; worried parents). The current version of MTS (2014) has 55 flowcharts
with 3 additional flowcharts which relate to children (unwell baby, unwell newborn, abused or neglected child). 
In MTS, there are no child age-specific parameters available for abnormal pulse or respirations for children. The recommendation
that ‘age appropriate definitions of bradycardia and tachycardia should be used in children’ (MTS 2014, p 161) was considered
by the ICTS project sub-group to be too subjective for the assessment of children. In addition, ‘increased work of breathing’
(MTS 2014, p149) explains increased respiratory rate without providing guidance on age-related clinically relevant parameters. 
4.3 canadian Paediatric triage and acuity scale guideline (Paedctas)
PaedCTAS (Warren et al 2001, 2008) was the only child specific triage system identified and is also a 5-tiered triage scale.
PaedCTAS was considered to be less user-friendly than MTS but included an age-specific physiologic parameter assessment.
Warren et al (2008) identified that abnormal respiratory rate and heart rate may be the only indication of underlying sepsis or
impending shock. With this in mind the 'Vital Signs Reference Grids’ previously adapted in OLCHC from the age-specific
physiologic parameter assessment used in PaedCTAS were incorporated into the Irish Children’s Triage System (Appendix 1.1).
Education and training in PaedCTAS system of triage was not readily available in Ireland and this was considered an essential
element in developing a formalised triage tool. 
4. Background to irish children’s triage system
V1  |  Irish Children’s Triage System  |  National Emergency Medicine Programme  |  2016©
9
Neither MTS nor PaedCTAS on their own were considered to fully address the needs of the Irish paediatric patient population or
the users of the system, thus the merits of both systems were identified and merged into one child-specific triage tool, namely
the Irish Children’s Triage System (ICTS).
It was agreed to use a similar format to that of MTS as the flow charts used in MTS were thought to be user friendly and easy to
follow. It was also considered appropriate to build on a system that was already familiar to staff rather than introduce a completely
new system that would require substantial re-education. Furthermore, ICTS adapted the use of numbering of categories and ideal
time targets from MTS rather than target times recommended in the Canadian or Australasian triage tools. Finally, the physiologic
parameters assessment of PaedCTAS, as modified previously for use in OLCHC, was incorporated into the new tool (5.2 Tables
1,2,3).
Hereafter, ICTS was developed using flowcharts representing the 22 most common paediatric presenting complaints to Irish
EDs. As the presenting signs and symptoms of childhood illnesses can be insidious in nature and the presenting complaint may
therefore not always fit neatly into one of the defined flowcharts, two additional default flowcharts of Unwell Child and Unwell
Infant (including pyrexia) were developed that would be comprehensive enough to capture all potential clinical risk. It is vital,
however, that if there is an alternative flowchart more specific to the patient’s presenting complaint that this specialised flowchart
is used and the flowcharts Unwell Child and Unwell Infant (including pyrexia) are only used where a more appropriate flow chart
is not available. 
5.1 special case guidelines
There are some conditions where patients may present and appear well but their underlying condition indicates that these patients
can deteriorate at a very rapid rate. With this in mind patients with a history of metabolic disorder, Sickle Cell Disease, patients
with a tracheostomy and breathing difficulties or patients with ventriculo-peritoneal shunt problems should never receive a lower
acuity than category 2.
In addition, the triage of patients with a co-existing medical problem or extremes of age provides particularly difficult challenges
(Veen et al 2008). Patients with significant co-existing illness and co-morbidity are a group in which assessment and management
is frequently complex, even with normal childhood illnesses. The ICTS project subgroup gave these children specific consideration
(as well as children and babies < 3 months of age) and decided that in the absence of indicators for a higher category, these
patients should never be categorised lower than category 3.

There is no consensus in relation to the minimum clinical experience a nurse needs prior to undertaking triage. Some systems
recommend that the nurse must be an ‘experienced’ nurse without quantifying what defines a nurse as ‘experienced’ (Beveridge
et al 1998, O’Neill & Molczan 2003, ACEM 2005, Gilboy et al 2005). Morgan & Whelan (2000) recommended that the nurse
should have at least 18 months of emergency nursing experience. However, Wulp et al (2008) have not found any association
between work experience and interrater reliability at triage. Gilboy et al (2005) recommend a 2-4 hour mandatory educational
programme for staff whilst Maldona & Avner (2004) recommend 6 hours of formalised triage training. 
Crellin & Johnson (2003) previously suggested that nurses not specifically trained in paediatrics may find triaging paediatric
patients challenging due to lack of expertise in the physiological and cognitive differences in children. This potentially leads to
children being allocated a lower priority triage category (category 5) less often.
While it is acknowledged that some ED experience is essential to assist the nurse in identifying a critically ill patient, the ICTS
Project Subgroup consider that education of staff in the use of the tool is essential prior to undertaking unsupervised triage.
Education of staff involves formal teaching sessions, supervised triage episodes and completion of a competency sign off booklet.
However, if there are concerns in relation to a nurse’s performance in relation to appropriate/accurate triage decisions, he/she
may undertake the triage workbook again to ensure further support/evaluation is provided. It is recommended that ongoing
concerns regarding triage performance should be managed through local nursing practice development structures.

ICTS was piloted in six sites from March 2013 – February 2014. In preparation for the pilot phase of ICTS, permission was sought
from the Directors of Nursing of each participating hospital. No data protection or patient confidentiality risks were identified.
All pilot sites identified local champions who would lead on training in their own ED. Formal teaching sessions, which comprised
an eight-hour study day were organised for each participating pilot site. This education was provided by the Clinical Nurse
Managers (CNM3) from the three paediatric EDs who had been pivotal in developing the ICTS tool. 
The champions train-the-trainer approach ensured that training of all staff was standardised across the six sites. Clinical training
and instruction of nurses has been previously identified as assisting in optimising the usage and interpretation of triage systems
(Veen & Moll 2009). The pilot phase was managed by the ICTS project subgroup who addressed operational issues and provided
support to each site. Prior to and during the pilot phase the project subgroup carried out audits, staff questionnaires and inter-
rater reliability studies, to support on-going evaluation and validation of the tool. 
The pilot phase was planned to take place over a 3-month period, however, the tool was found to be so beneficial that all six EDs
opted to continue to use the ICTS after the end of the pilot period. As a result, audit data was gathered from the participating
hospitals for the period March 2013 - February 2014. The additional audit period allowed the project subgroup to ensure that the
results of audit were not influenced by seasonal variation. Data was gathered from the six EDs for the year preceding the
introduction of ICTS (i.e. March 2012 - February 2013). This allowed the allocation of triage categories to be compared pre and
post introduction of ICTS.

In addition to the data collected by all six hospitals the three paediatric EDs were able to review the triage categories of children
who required admission to Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU) for the year before and year after the introduction of the ICTS (Tables
3a & 3b).

observations on data results
Nurses who do not have paediatric training may find the triaging of paediatric patients challenging (Crellin & Johnson 2003). In
addition, nurses who do not work exclusively with paediatrics may be hesitant to use lower acuity categories (Figures 1a and
1b). However, following the ICTS training in the pilot sites there was a notable change in the use of triage category 4 in Hospital
1. Hospital 2 shows a small increase in the use of the lower triage categories with little change in Hospital 3. 
In relation to the three paediatric hospitals (Hospitals 4-6), there was a significant difference in the allocation of triage categories
between Hospitals 4 and 6 and Hospital 5 but following the introduction of ICTS, the three paediatric EDs showed very similar
patterns of attendance by triage category. 
Although a triage tool is not designed to determine whether a child would subsequently require admission to hospital, the ICTS
project subgroup attempted to establish a correlation between the higher acuity triage categories and admission rates (Figures
2a & 2b). Hospital 1 had a reduction in the overall % of lower triage categories 4. Hospitals 2, 4 and 5 had a significant increase
in the percentage of higher triage category 2 being admitted (admission rate as an overall percentage of admissions). However
there was little change noted in Hospitals 3 and 6. 
The admission rate per triage category as an overall proportion of admissions was much more consistent.  Yet again, after the
introduction of ICTS the three paediatric EDs were very similar in admissions per triage category as an overall percentage of
admissions.
The three paediatric EDs were in a position to collect data on children admitted to PICU. Gravel et al (2009) reports that 90% of
patients admitted to intensive care were categorised as category 1 or 2 (using the Canadian Paediatric Triage and Acuity Scale).
Prior to the introduction of the ICTS, the 3 paediatric EDs reported a similar categorisation pattern for children admitted to ICU.
However, at that time, 8% of those admissions to PICU had received a triage category 3 and 2% had received a triage category
4 (Figure 3a). Following the introduction of the ICTS, 94% of admissions to PICU were either a triage category 1 or 2 and no
patient received a triage category 4 or 5 (Figure 3b). The findings in relation to initial acuity assessment and the need for PICU
beds would suggest that the ICTS tool can identify acutely ill children and ensure that these children receive immediate and
urgent medical attention.

Triage systems are designed to appreciate the value of human life and health with fairness and the efficient use of resources
(Fitzgerald et al 2009). Triage should only be used if there is a delay in patients receiving medical attention, thereby reducing
clinical risk.  Consequently, if there are no patients waiting for medical review, there should be no delay in the patient receiving
medical attention and the patient should receive a nursing and medical assessment simultaneously. 
The triage process tends to incur delays, especially in the younger age group of attendees. Therefore, it is recommended that
consideration should be given to develop a local contingency plan when there are delays for triage to ensure that all patients are
seen by a nurse or doctor in a timely fashion.
Triage is sometimes used by hospital managers and service planners as a marker of acuity and complexity of care within EDs,
hospitals and networks of care. This has led to considerations that patients in ‘lower’ triage categories (triage categories 3-5)
could be easily and safely managed in alternative healthcare settings. This misuse of triage data is potentially dangerous because
triage is essentially a tool to facilitate ‘clinical justice’ identifying which patients need to be seen sooner; it is not a marker of how
complex or qualified that medical care is. 
One of the major limitations of any triage tool is difficulty in its validation. A number of audits of ICTS have been undertaken to
ensure that it is a robust and comprehensive tool (outlined in the previous section). Further audit and evaluation is planned as
EDs throughout Ireland commence implementation of ICTS. The recommendation from the National Emergency Medicine
Programme and ICTS project subgroup is that continuous audit should be carried out at local level and all variations analysed
locally and discussed within ED multidisciplinary teams. Learning from local audits should be shared with the National Emergency
Medicine Programme and used to inform further refinement of the tool.

The National Emergency Medicine Programme consistently strives to improve the care that is delivered to patients, their families
and carers who attend EDs throughout the country. The triage system outlined in this document aims to assist in ensuring that
children who attend Irish EDs receive the best possible effective and timely care. 
Overall feedback on the pilot phase of the project was very positive from staff in all participating EDs. Emergency nurses found
that ICTS was a safe and user friendly tool which guided them to quickly recognise sick children presenting to their department. 
In conclusion the recommendation of the National Emergency Medicine Programme is that the Irish Children's Triage System
should be adopted as the national standard of triage for children and should be implemented in all EDs in Ireland with paediatric
attendances.

emergency, and requires immediate treatment
Bsa Body Surface Area
Burns (Thermal injury) Burn: An injury to flesh or skin caused by heat, chemicals, chemicals, radiation
or radiation
circumferential burn: The burn encircles an entire body part. May cause
neurovascular compromise to the body part
chemical burn: A burn caused by a chemical substances
Electrical injuries: Relatively uncommon. Children with electrical burns are
predominantly injured in the household setting. The spectrum of electrical injury
is broad, ranging from minimal injury to severe multi-organ involvement to death
Flame burn: A burn caused by heat or flame also called a thermal burn
scald: Caused by hot liquids or steam
Full thickness: Third degree burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis
and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate
Partial thickness: This burn destroys the epidermal layer and portions of the
dermis. Since it does not extend through both layers, it is termed a partial
thickness burn 
minor burn: A minor burn is confined exclusively to the outer surface and is not
considered a significant burn. No barrier functions are altered
central capillary refill time Capillary time is the rate at which blood returns to the capillary bed after cutaneous
pressure on the sternum for 5 seconds (normal ≤ 2 seconds). It should never be
measured in isolation and should be considered along with other clinical signs
compensated shock Blood flow to vital organs i.e. heart and brain is spared at the expense of non-
essential organs. A child in this phase is typically mildly agitated or confused,
tachycardic and has cool, pale skin with decreased capillary refill time

10) on a validated pain score tool (e.g. Wong Baker pain scale/Pain ruler/FLACC
Pain Scale/Alder Hey pain score tools)
moderate: Pain is bearable but intense; 4-6/10 on a validated pain score tool (e.g.
Wong Baker pain scale/Pain ruler/FLACC Scale/Alder Hey pain score tools)
mild: Mild stinging causes few problems, can do most things; 1-3/10 on a
validated pain score tool (e.g. Wong Baker pain score/Pain ruler/FLACC
Scale/Alder Hey pain score tools)
Petechiae Pinpoint, flat round red spots under the skin surface caused by intradermal
haemorrhage. They do not blanch when pressure is applied. This rash should be
considered as an emergency in triage and should never receive less than a triage
category 2 
rigors An attack of shivering that occurs when the heat-regulating centre malfunctions.
There is a rapid increase in body temperature which remains elevated until profuse
sweating takes place
sudden loss of vision Sudden visual loss is a common complaint with variable presentations among
patients of different ages. Some patients describe their symptoms as a gradually
descending gray-black curtain or as blurring, fogging, or dimming of vision.
Symptoms usually last a few minutes but can persist for hours. Variation in
frequency ranges from a single episode to many episodes per day; recurrences
may continue for years but more frequently occur over seconds to hours
tripod Positioning A position that may be assumed during respiratory distress to facilitate the use
of respiratory accessory muscles. The patient sits leaning forward, with hands
placed on the bed or a table with arms braced.
